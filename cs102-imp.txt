Git is a widely used version control system that allows software developers to track changes to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become a cornerstone of modern software development.

One of the most important features of Git is its ability to create branches, which allow developers to work on different versions of their code simultaneously. This allows for experimentation and collaboration without disrupting the main codebase. Branches can then be merged back into the main codebase once they are complete.
